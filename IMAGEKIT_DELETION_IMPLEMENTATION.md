# ImageKit Deletion Implementation

## Overview

All delete operations now automatically remove files from ImageKit in addition to deleting from the database. This prevents orphaned files and saves storage costs.

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ Smart File Deletion

When you delete:
- **Single Photo/Video** ‚Üí Deletes from database + ImageKit
- **Multiple Photos/Videos** ‚Üí Deletes all from database + ImageKit
- **Stream** ‚Üí Deletes stream, all its items from database + ImageKit
- **Slideshow** ‚Üí Deletes slideshow, all streams, all items, and background image from database + ImageKit

### ‚úÖ Automatic Cleanup

The system intelligently extracts file identifiers from:
- Full ImageKit URLs (e.g., `https://ik.imagekit.io/xyz/file.jpg`)
- Storage paths (e.g., `/slideshows/file.jpg`)
- File IDs directly

### ‚úÖ Error Handling

- Database deletion happens first (critical operation)
- ImageKit deletion happens in background (non-blocking)
- Failures in ImageKit deletion don't break the UI
- All errors are logged to console for debugging

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/lib/imagekit.ts`
**Added:**
- `extractFileId()` - Smart extraction of file ID from URL or path
- Enhanced `deleteFromImageKit()` - Works with URLs, paths, or file IDs
- Better error messages

**Example:**
```typescript
// All of these work:
await deleteFromImageKit('file-id-123');
await deleteFromImageKit('/slideshows/photo.jpg');
await deleteFromImageKit('https://ik.imagekit.io/abc/photo.jpg');
```

### 2. `/src/services/photo.ts`
**Updated:**
- `deleteStreamItem()` - Deletes item + file from ImageKit
- `deleteMultipleStreamItems()` - Batch deletes items + files

**Behavior:**
```typescript
// When you delete a photo:
1. Fetch item from database to get file info
2. Delete from database
3. Extract file identifier (storage_path or url)
4. Delete from ImageKit (background, non-blocking)
5. Log success/failure
```

### 3. `/src/services/stream.ts`
**Updated:**
- `deleteStream()` - Deletes stream + all its items' files

**Behavior:**
```typescript
// When you delete a stream:
1. Fetch all items in the stream
2. Delete stream from database (cascade deletes items)
3. For each item, delete file from ImageKit
4. All ImageKit deletions happen in parallel
```

### 4. `/src/services/slideshow.ts`
**Updated:**
- `deleteSlideshow()` - Complete cleanup of slideshow and all assets

**Behavior:**
```typescript
// When you delete a slideshow:
1. Fetch all streams and their items
2. Fetch slideshow settings (for background image)
3. Delete slideshow from database (cascade deletes everything)
4. Collect all file identifiers:
   - Background image (if exists)
   - All photos/videos from all streams
5. Delete all files from ImageKit in parallel
6. Log total cleanup count
```

## How It Works

### Deletion Flow

```
User clicks delete
    ‚Üì
Get file info from database
    ‚Üì
Delete from database (blocks UI)
    ‚Üì
Extract file identifier
    ‚Üì
Call ImageKit Edge Function (background)
    ‚Üì
ImageKit deletion (doesn't block UI)
    ‚Üì
Log success/failure
```

### File Identifier Extraction

The system handles various formats:

```typescript
// Full URL
"https://ik.imagekit.io/abc/slideshows/photo.jpg"
‚Üí extracts: "photo.jpg"

// Storage path
"/slideshows/photo.jpg"
‚Üí extracts: "photo.jpg"

// Direct file ID
"abc123xyz.jpg"
‚Üí uses: "abc123xyz.jpg"
```

### Parallel Deletion

When deleting multiple files (stream or slideshow):

```typescript
// All deletions happen in parallel
Promise.allSettled([
  deleteFromImageKit(file1),
  deleteFromImageKit(file2),
  deleteFromImageKit(file3),
  // ... etc
]);

// Failures don't affect other deletions
// UI doesn't wait for completion
```

## Edge Function Required

Make sure your `imagekit-delete` Edge Function is deployed:

```typescript
// Supabase Edge Function: imagekit-delete
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

serve(async (req) => {
  // Authenticate user
  const supabaseClient = createClient(...)
  const { data: { user } } = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser()
  
  if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized')
  
  // Get fileId from request
  const { fileId } = await req.json()
  
  // Delete from ImageKit API
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.imagekit.io/v1/files/${fileId}`,
    {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Basic ${btoa(privateKey + ':')}`,
      },
    }
  )
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }))
})
```

## Console Messages

Watch the browser console to see deletion activity:

### Success Messages
```
Deleted file from ImageKit
Deleted file from ImageKit (stream cleanup)
Deleted file from ImageKit (slideshow cleanup)
Cleaning up 15 files from ImageKit...
```

### Error Messages
```
Failed to delete from ImageKit: [error details]
Failed to delete file from ImageKit: [error details]
Could not extract fileId from: [url]
```

## Testing

### Test Single Photo Deletion
```
1. Upload a photo to a stream
2. Delete the photo
3. Check console: "Deleted file from ImageKit"
4. Verify in ImageKit dashboard: file is gone
```

### Test Stream Deletion
```
1. Create stream with 5 photos
2. Delete the stream
3. Check console: "Deleted file from ImageKit (stream cleanup)" √ó 5
4. Verify in ImageKit: all 5 files gone
```

### Test Slideshow Deletion
```
1. Create slideshow with 3 streams, 20 total photos
2. Add background image
3. Delete the slideshow
4. Check console: "Cleaning up 21 files from ImageKit..."
5. Verify in ImageKit: all files gone
```

### Test Bulk Deletion
```
1. Select 10 photos in a stream
2. Click "Delete Selected"
3. Check console: Multiple "Deleted file from ImageKit" messages
4. Verify in ImageKit: all 10 files gone
```

## Error Scenarios

### ImageKit API Error
```
User deletes photo
‚Üí Database deletion succeeds ‚úÖ
‚Üí ImageKit deletion fails ‚ùå
‚Üí Error logged to console
‚Üí File remains orphaned in ImageKit (can be cleaned up later)
‚Üí User doesn't see error (non-critical)
```

### Network Error
```
User deletes photo while offline
‚Üí Database deletion succeeds ‚úÖ
‚Üí ImageKit deletion fails ‚ùå (network error)
‚Üí Error logged to console
‚Üí File remains in ImageKit
‚Üí Can be retried manually if needed
```

### Edge Function Not Deployed
```
User deletes photo
‚Üí Database deletion succeeds ‚úÖ
‚Üí ImageKit API call fails ‚ùå (404)
‚Üí Error logged: "Failed to delete file from ImageKit: 404"
‚Üí Deploy Edge Function to fix
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup** - No manual ImageKit management needed
‚úÖ **Cost Savings** - Prevents orphaned files accumulating
‚úÖ **Non-Blocking** - UI stays responsive during ImageKit deletions
‚úÖ **Safe** - Database deletion happens first (critical)
‚úÖ **Parallel** - Multiple files deleted simultaneously
‚úÖ **Smart** - Works with URLs, paths, or IDs
‚úÖ **Logged** - All operations visible in console
‚úÖ **Resilient** - ImageKit failures don't break the UI

## Potential Improvements

Future enhancements could include:

1. **Retry Logic** - Automatically retry failed deletions
2. **Batch API Calls** - Delete multiple files in one API call
3. **Cleanup Queue** - Track failed deletions for retry
4. **Manual Cleanup Tool** - Find and remove orphaned files
5. **Deletion Confirmation** - Show ImageKit deletion status in UI
6. **Storage Analytics** - Track space saved from deletions

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Deleting from ImageKit

**Check:**
1. Edge Function deployed? `imagekit-delete`
2. ImageKit credentials correct? Check `.env`
3. Console errors? Look for specific error messages
4. Network issues? Check browser Network tab

**Solutions:**
- Deploy Edge Function to Supabase
- Verify ImageKit API keys in Edge Function
- Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
- Test Edge Function directly

### Console Warnings

```
"Could not extract fileId from: undefined"
```
**Cause:** Item doesn't have storage_path or url
**Solution:** Normal for items without files (shouldn't happen with photos/videos)

```
"Failed to delete from ImageKit: 404"
```
**Cause:** File already deleted or doesn't exist
**Solution:** Safe to ignore, cleanup successful anyway

## Summary

All deletion operations now automatically clean up ImageKit files:
- ‚úÖ Single items delete their file
- ‚úÖ Multiple items delete all files
- ‚úÖ Streams delete all item files
- ‚úÖ Slideshows delete everything (items + background)
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking background deletion
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Smart file ID extraction

**Result:** No more orphaned files in ImageKit! üéâ
